# It simulates a table, that can be scanned by a camera, that's pointing towards it.
# By selecting one of the available actions, you can 
# control that camera to scan a different area of the table
# You can get the ratio of scanned areas on the table, to check 
# how well you've discovered everything on the table.
#
# This provides an example scenario for a learning
# agent, that is supposed to find out
# the best action sequence, to scan the table in a minimum amount of time
